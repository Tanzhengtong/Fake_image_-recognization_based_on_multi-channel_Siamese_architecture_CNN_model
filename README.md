# Fake_image_-recognization_based_on_multi-channel_Siamese_architecture_CNN_model
This project aims to build a convolutional neural network model based on multi-channel Siamese architecture and combine with self-defined judgment rules to detect the authenticity of images on the housing rental platform. Data sets and some of codes will not uploaded due to the Copyright issue.
